# 🎯 C++ Assignments Repository

Welcome to my **C++ Programs Repository**!  
This repository contains all the assignments and practice programs I’ve completed as part of my learning journey in **Computer Engineering**.  

📘 Each assignment is organized and documented with a **short description** and a direct link to the source code.  
This is meant to serve as a reference for students, beginners, and anyone learning **C++ programming**.

# 📂 Assignments

### 📝 Assignment 1: Object Oriented Programming
> Implementation of a `person` class to demonstrate **classes, objects, default constructors, and parameterized constructors**.

---

### 📝 Assignment 2: Classes and Member Functions
> A program demonstrating an alternative way to initialize object data using a public member function (`ScanData`) instead of a constructor.

### 📝 Assignment 3: Constructors in C++
> Implementation of a `person` class to demonstrate **classes, objects, default constructors, and parameterized constructors**.

[![View Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/View_Code-181717?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](./Assignment%2003/assignment03.cpp)

---

### 📝 Assignment 4: Encapsulation with Getters and Setters
> Demonstrates the OOP principle of encapsulation using a `Person` class with public **getter and setter methods** to access and modify private data.

---

### 📝 Assignment 5: Data Validation in Classes
> Enhances the `Person` class by adding **input validation** logic within constructors and setter methods to ensure data integrity.

---

### 📝 Assignment 6: Dynamic Memory and Destructors
> A program demonstrating how to manage dynamic memory within a class using `new` in constructors and `delete`/`delete[]` in a **destructor** to prevent memory leaks.

[![View Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/View_Code-181717?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](./Assignment%2006/assignment06.cpp)

---

### 📝 Assignment 7: Dynamic Memory with Getters and Setters
> An `Employee` class that uses getters and setters for dynamically allocated data, showing how to correctly **deallocate and reallocate memory** in a setter to prevent memory leaks.

---

### 📝 Assignment 8: Shallow Copy vs. Deep Copy
> Illustrates the critical difference between a default **shallow copy** and a manual **deep copy**. This is crucial when a class contains pointers to dynamically allocated memory to prevent runtime errors like dangling pointers and double-free exceptions.

---

### 📝 Assignment 9: Types of Inheritance
> A comprehensive example demonstrating **single, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance**. It builds a class hierarchy from `Person` to `Developer` and its subtypes, also showing the use of `protected` members and constructor chaining.

---

### 📝 Assignment 10: Multiple Inheritance
> A program that demonstrates **multiple inheritance**, where a derived class (`Add2Obj`) inherits from two separate base classes (`Base1`, `Base2`) to combine their attributes and functionality.

[![View Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/View_Code-181717?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](./Assignment%2010/assignment10.cpp)

---

### 📝 Assignment 11: Hybrid Inheritance (The Diamond Problem)
> A program that resolves the **diamond problem** in hybrid inheritance (a mix of multiple and hierarchical) by using **virtual base classes** to avoid ambiguity.

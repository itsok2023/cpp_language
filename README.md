C++ Programming Assignments
Welcome to my repository of C++ programming assignments! This collection showcases my journey through various concepts in C++, from fundamental principles to more advanced topics. Each assignment is designed to solve a specific problem and demonstrate my understanding of the C++ language.

Assignments
Assignment 1: [Classes, Objects, and Constructors]
About: This program introduces core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It defines a person class with private data members (age, name) and demonstrates the use of both default and parameterized constructors to initialize objects. The code also utilizes the this pointer to differentiate between class members and parameters within the constructor.
